# Dependency Management Guide

## Overview

This document explains how Python dependencies are locked and managed across Lambda functions in this project to ensure reproducible builds and security.

## Lambda Functions with Locked Dependencies

The following Lambda functions have their dependencies locked using pip-tools:

| Lambda Function | Location | Requirements File |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| `case_generation` | `cdk/lambda/case_generation/` | `requirements.txt` |
| `text_generation` | `cdk/lambda/text_generation/` | `requirements.txt` |
| `summary_generation` | `cdk/lambda/summary_generation/` | `requirements.txt` |
| `audioToText` | `cdk/lambda/audioToText/` | `requirements.txt` |

## How Dependencies Were Locked

### 1. Requirements Structure

Each Lambda function uses a two-file approach:
- `requirements.in` - Contains high-level dependencies (what we directly need)
- `requirements.txt` - Contains all dependencies with exact versions (generated from requirements.in)

### 2. Locking Process

Dependencies were locked using pip-tools within locally built Docker containers to ensure consistency. 

Steps: 

```bash
# Navigate to the Lambda function directory
cd cdk/lambda/case_generation

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t case-gen-image .

# Run pip-tools inside the container
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app case-gen-image bash -c "
  pip install pip-tools &&
  pip-compile requirements.in
"
```

### 3. Key Locked Dependencies

**LangChain Ecosystem:**
```
langchain==0.3.25
langchain-aws==0.2.25
langchain-community==0.3.25
langchain-core==0.3.65
langchain-postgres==0.0.14
```

**Database Connectivity:**
```
psycopg[binary]==3.2.9
```

**AWS Services:**
```
boto3==1.38.37
botocore==1.38.37
```

## How to Modify Dependencies

### Adding New Dependencies

1. **Add to requirements.in:**
   Add the new package to requirements.in. You may optionally specify a version (e.g., langchain==1.3.5 or just langchain).

2. **Build Docker image locally:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the Lambda function directory
   cd cdk/lambda/case_generation
   
   # Build the Docker image locally
   docker build -t case-gen-image .
   ```

3. **Regenerate requirements.txt:**
   ```bash
   # Run pip-compile inside the built container
   docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app case-gen-image bash -c "
     pip install pip-tools && 
     pip-compile requirements.in
   "
   ```

4. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   After regenerating requirements.txt, commit and push the updated files to trigger the deployment pipeline.

   **Option 1: Using Git in the Terminal**
   ```bash
   # Stage the updated files
   git add requirements.in requirements.txt

   # Commit with a descriptive message
   git commit -m "Add new dependency to case_generation Lambda"

   # Push to your working branch (e.g., main or dev)
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

   **Option 2: Using Git in Your IDE (e.g., VS Code)**
   1. Go to the Source Control tab.

   2. You’ll see requirements.in and requirements.txt listed under Changes.

   3. Write a commit message (e.g., “Add new dependency to case_generation Lambda”).

   4. Click ✓ Commit.

   5. Click the … menu or right-click → Push to send your changes to the remote repository.

Once the push is complete, CodePipeline will automatically detect the change, rebuild the Docker image, and redeploy the Lambda function.

### Updating Existing Dependencies

1. **Update version in requirements.in:**
   ```bash
   # Change from: langchain
   # To: langchain==0.4.0
   ```

2. **Build Docker image locally:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the Lambda function directory
   cd cdk/lambda/case_generation
   
   # Build the Docker image locally
   docker build -t case-gen-image .
   ```

3. **Regenerate requirements.txt:**
   ```bash
   # Run pip-compile inside the built container
   docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app case-gen-image bash -c "
     pip install pip-tools && 
     pip-compile requirements.in
   "
   ```

4. **Commit and Push Changes:**

Once `requirements.txt` has been updated, commit and push the changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline and redeploy the updated Lambda function.
