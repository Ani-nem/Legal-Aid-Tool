# Legal-Aid-Tool
This prototype explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance legal workflows by enabling intelligent case analysis, real-time transcription, and contextual feedback. By integrating AI into the legal process, it supports more efficient decision-making, improves accessibility to complex information, and fosters a deeper understanding of legal content through personalized, adaptive assistance.

```

1. `/cdk`: Contains the deployment code for the app's AWS infrastructure
   - `/bin`: Contains the instantiation of CDK stack
   - `/data_ingestion`: Contains the code required for the Data Ingestion step in retrieval-augmented generation. This folder is used by a Lambda function that runs a container which updates the vectorstore for a course when files are uploaded or deleted.
   - `/lambda`: Contains the lambda functions for the project
   - `/layers`: Contains the required layers for lambda functions
   - `/lib`: Contains the deployment code for all infrastructure stacks
   - `/graphql`: Contains the GraphQL schema and resolvers for the API.
2. `/docs`: Contains documentation for the application.
3. `/frontend`: Contains the user interface of the general public application

## API Documentation

Here you can learn about the API the project uses: [API Documentation](./docs/api-documentation.pdf).

## Modification Guide
